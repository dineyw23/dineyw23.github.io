## I'll give you an overview of my projects...

1. [Goldchase](https://github.com/dineyw23/Distributed-Programming): 
  A multiplayer game focusing on distributed programming and inter-process communication developed using C++. Currently working on its object oriented design.
2. [String Substitution](https://bitbucket.org/dineyw23/object-oriented-programming/src):
  Object oriented mini-project developed in C++ which can be used for text substitution(Find and Replace) using minimal buffer. Reading the file only once and replacing the text in a single iteration using a dynamic buffer of size much less than that of replacement word are the key aspects of this project. Used std::fstream library.

  An android application to take notes (Flash cards) using android’s 3D flip animation with proximity  alert system and 'Share with classmates' feature.  
  * Technology: Android, Google Map API.
  * Tools: IntelliJ, AWS(EC2)
4. AuctionPro: 
In the E-commerce world, competition is booming and maintaining a top spot needs new and creative ideas. Designed and developed a windows application which can be used with number of E-commerce sites where auctioning facility is not available. This project furnished my skill to write optimum stored procedures and maintain database connectivity with the front-end.
5. [Security](http://www.advanceresearchlibrary.com/vol3jct4.aspx): 
Importance of network security motivated me to work as a group leader in a group of four under the domain of Network security.
Developed a tool for high security devices like PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant). This inexpensive system uses color rating along with text to generate different passwords each time. It is not vulnerable to eavesdropping,dictionary attacks, social engineering and shoulder surfing. 
Technology: C# and .NET framework 
  * Tools: Eclipse IDE and Rational Rose(ER-Diagrams)
