Hi, I'm Diney Wankhede. I am a constant learner who is living in California. I'm currently working towards my Masters Degree in Computer Science.
Alongside, I work as a Student Assistant at Distributed Learning Technologies at Chico State.
I hope to share some of my work here.
Okay, be patient! 
Diney is learning to develop a site for free using Jekyll.
