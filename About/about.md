Hello. I am Diney Wankhede. I am a student, a learner and an Indian who lives in California. I'm currently working towards my Masters Degree in Computer Science at California State University, Chico.
Alongside, I work as a Student Assistant at Distributed Learning Technologies - Chico State. 
I am passionate about technology, programming and design. This site will help you to know me better. I code and  hope to share some of my work here.
