Hi, My name is Diney Wankhede. I'm a persistent learner, Indian by origin who is living in California. I'm currently working towards my Masters Degree in Computer Science.
Alongside, I work as a Student Assistant at Distributed Learning Technologies - Chico State.
I hope to share some of my work here.

  > Okay, be patient! Diney is learning to develop a site for free using Jekyll.
